Which of the following statements comparing singly-linked lists to doubly-linked lists is generally true, given two otherwise similar linked list implementations?

each element in a doubly-linked list incurs more memory overhead than each element
in a singly-linked list

prepending an element to the doubly linked list will have better runtime complexity than

deleting the head of the doubly linked list will have better runtime complexity than the
same operation on the singly linked list

the doubly-linked list can make use of a sentinel head,while the singly-linked list can
not
