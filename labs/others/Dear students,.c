Dear students,

This is your fifth self-evaluated lab. Remember, you will need to submit the result of this lab to move on to the next module. 

Estimated Time: 1hr

Attempt: 1

How to Pass: Run your lab successfully on your C compiler.

What to Doï¼š

Step1-Modify below code and add another function min(num1, num2) to run.

Also create arithmetic operational functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo operation) to display each operational result using the functions.

#include <stdio.h>
/*function declaration */
int max (int numl,int num2);
int min (int numl,int num2);
int main ()
{
/*local variable definition */
int a 100;
int b 200;
int ret;
/*calling a function to get max value */
ret max (a,b);
printf("Max value is &d\n",ret )
/*add implementation to use min function to display */
/*add below to add max and min functions */
return 0;
}
Suggested Output-Proper values by arithmetic operations (by using functions) as well as finding max or min value.
